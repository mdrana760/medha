  "summary": "Implemented a single-page React gift-box experience with gradient background, click-triggered animation state machine, floating heart background, and Web Speech API voice with a user-gesture fallback prompt. However, required generated art assets are not present in the diff, and additional authentication/actor/react-query infrastructure was introduced despite being out of scope.",

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Add any required custom art as static assets (not served through the backend) and reference them from the frontend. Any generated images are placed under frontend/public/assets/generated and loaded directly by the frontend.",
      "reason": "The frontend references generated image paths (e.g., heart icon), but the diff does not include any added image files under frontend/public/assets/generated (or anywhere). Therefore the required custom art assets are not implemented/shipped in this change set.",
